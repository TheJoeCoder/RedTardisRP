## To contribute
* First, download Git for your platform. This is easier to do by installing [GitHub desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). Open the app and sign into (or create) a GitHub account.
* Secondly, clone a repository by going to `File -> Clone`. Select URL and type `https://github.com/TheJoeCoder/RedTardisRP.git`. Select a place to save the texture pack and press `Clone`.
* Press the `Master` branch icon above and press `New Branch`. Give it a name, then `Publish Branch`.
* Edit the files, add and edit textures, etc.
* Once you're finished, go back to GitHub Desktop and commit your changes with a message.
* Then, press `Push Origin`.
* Your changes should be synced to the GitHub page and a new build of the resource pack should appear on https://ci.radialbog9.uk/job/RedTardisRP/ shortly under your branch name.
* Once you've tested your version, press the `Create Pull Request` button. This will take you to GitHub where you can add a description to your PR. Create it and wait for the checks to finish. It can then be merged.
* Be sure to delete your branch and create a new one when you want to make more changes. 

If you're already familiar with Git, then you can just use git via console in the same way.

Additionally, please note that your account will have to be approved in order to push to the repository. Please send a message to `Radialbog9#0001` to get approved as a contributor.
