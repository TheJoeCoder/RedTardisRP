# Red-Industries Tardis Resource Pack
This is the Tardis server resource pack.

If you want to contribute, read below. Otherwise, download the latest version of the pack [here](https://ci.radialbog9.uk/job/RedTardisRP/job/master/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/redtardis.zip).

## To contribute
### Download Git/GitHub Desktop and Clone the Repo
Download Git for your platform. This is easier to do by installing [GitHub desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). Open the app and sign into (or create) a GitHub account.

### Clone the repository
Secondly, clone a repository by going to `File -> Clone`. Select URL and type `https://github.com/TheJoeCoder/RedTardisRP.git`. Select a place to save the texture pack and press `Clone`.

### Edit and Commit to new branch
* On GitHub Desktop, click `Current branch` at the top, then select the `New Branch` button.
* Give it a name and then press `Create Branch`.
* Press `Publish Branch` to save the new branch to GitHub.
* Edit the files, add and edit textures, etc. Do NOT press `Create Pull Request` just yet!
* Once you're finished, go back to GitHub Desktop and commit your changes with a message.
* Then, press `Push Origin`.
* Your changes should now be merged into the branch you created.

### Create a Pull Request
#### From GitHub Web
* On the top bar under the repo name, click on `Pull Requests`, or, alternatively, click on [this link](https://github.com/TheJoeCoder/RedTardisRP/pulls).
* Click `New Pull Request`.
* For `base`, select the branch you want to merge *into* .
* For `compare`, select the branch you want to merge *from* (e.g. your test branch).
* Click `Create Pull Request`.
* Add a title and description and then press `Create Pull Request` again.
* Even if you have the privilege to, I wouldn't recommend merging the request yourself until someone else has reviewed and commented on it.

### Edit and Commit to master branch (not recommended)
Directly editing the master branch is *not* recommended. Instead, follow the steps above to create a new branch and then create a pull request. This means that people can review your changes without them affecting the main texture pack.
* Edit the files, add and edit textures, etc.
* Once you're finished, go back to GitHub Desktop and commit your changes with a message.
* Then, press `Push Origin`.
* Your changes should now be merged into the main branch.

### More Info
For more info about how to use GitHub Desktop, view this [GitHub Desktop Tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/overview/getting-started-with-github-desktop).

If you're already familiar with Git, then you can just use git via console in the same way.

Additionally, please note that your account will have to be approved in order to directly push to the repository. Please send a message to `Radialbog9#0001` to get approved as a contributor. Alternatively, you can fork this repository and create a pull request.
