# Red-Industries Tardis Resource Pack
This is the Tardis server resource pack.

## To contribute
* First, download Git for your platform. This is easier to do by installing [GitHub desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). Open the app and sign into (or create) a GitHub account.
* Secondly, clone a repository by going to `File -> Clone`. Select URL and type `https://github.com/TheJoeCoder/RedTardisRP.git`. Select a place to save the texture pack and press `Clone`.
* Edit the files, add and edit textures, etc.
* Once you're finished, go back to GitHub Desktop and commit your changes with a message.
* Then, press `Push Origin`.
* Your changes should be synced to the GitHub page and a new build of the resource pack should appear on https://ci.radialbog9.uk shortly.

If you're already familiar with Git, then you can just use git via console in the same way.
