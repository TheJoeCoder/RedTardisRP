# Red-Industries Tardis Resource Pack
This is the Tardis server resource pack.

If you want to contribute, read below. Otherwise, download the latest version of the pack [here](https://ci.radialbog9.uk/job/RedTardisRP/job/master/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/redtardis.zip).

## To contribute
* First, download Git for your platform. This is easier to do by installing [GitHub desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). Open the app and sign into (or create) a GitHub account.
* Secondly, clone a repository by going to `File -> Clone`. Select URL and type `https://github.com/TheJoeCoder/RedTardisRP.git`. Select a place to save the texture pack and press `Clone`.
* Edit the files, add and edit textures, etc.
* Once you're finished, go back to GitHub Desktop and commit your changes with a message.
* Then, press `Push Origin`.
* Your changes should now be merged into the main branch.

If you're already familiar with Git, then you can just use git via console in the same way.

Additionally, please note that your account will have to be approved in order to push to the repository. Please send a message to `Radialbog9#0001` to get approved as a contributor.
